  "readme": "# Robeaux\n\nRobeaux (/rō-bō/) is a universal dashboard to your robotic devices. Like a router admin\npage, but for robots.\n\nRobeaux is powered by [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), and provides\na front-end to the API interface offered by [Artoo](http://artoo.io),\n[Cylon.js](http://cylonjs.com) and [Gobot](http://gobot.io). It looks like this:\n\n![Robeaux Interface](http://i.imgur.com/T50PhUe.png)\n\n## How It Works\n\nThanks to using a structured interface based on the RESTful APIs of Artoo,\nCylon.js and Gobot, Robeaux can query or set values on one or more robots, and\nall of the devices connected to each robot. As long as they are connected to\na compatible API server.\n\n### Robots\n\nYou can see each robot that your are connected to, and then drill in to view or\nedit it.\n\n![Robots View](http://i.imgur.com/T50PhUe.png)\n\n### Connections\n\nHow are you connected? Serial port? WiFi? View the details for each of your\nrobots.\n\n![Connections View](http://i.imgur.com/OKwG3P7.png)\n\n### Devices\n\nEach robot has one or more devices connected. You can view the device status and\nsend commands all via the web interface. You can even stream the real-time\nevent data for your buttons, switches, LEDs, sensors, and more.\n\n![Devices View](http://i.imgur.com/tTkyx3q.png)\n\n## Themes\n\nYou can change the theme! Pick from one of the presets, or write your own. It'll\nbe persisted in `localStorage` and ready to go for the next time you want to use\nRobeaux.\n\n![Custom Theme Editor](http://i.imgur.com/5yefYn9.png)\n\n## Pushing new versions\n\nBefore you push a new release, make sure you've bumped the version in\n`package.json` and `robeaux.gemspec`, and commited + pushed those changes.\n\nThen, just run `make release`. It'll take care of:\n\n- cutting a git tag\n- pushing tags to GitHub\n- building/pushing a new RubyGem\n- publishing a new NPM release\n\n## Releases\n\n- 0.2.0 - Update for CPP-IO API spec\n\n- 0.1.1 - Remove dependency on Google WebFonts\n\n- 0.1.0 - Full rewrite. Supports Server-Sent-Events.\n\n- 0.0.4 - Feature improvements\n\n- 0.0.3 - Feature improvements\n\n- 0.0.2 - Initial release.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nCopyright (c) 2014 The Hybrid Group\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use\nthis file except in compliance with the License.

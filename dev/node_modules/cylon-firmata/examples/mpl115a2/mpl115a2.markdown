# MPL115A2

First, let's import Cylon:

    var Cylon = require('cylon');

Now that we have Cylon imported, we can start defining our robot

    Cylon.robot({

Let's define the connections and devices:

      connection: { name: 'arduino', adaptor: 'firmata', port: '/dev/ttyACM0' },
      device: { name: 'mpl115a2', driver: 'mpl115a2' },

Now that Cylon knows about the necessary hardware we're going to be using, we'll
tell it what work we want to do:

      work: function(my) {
        my.mpl115a2.getTemperature(function(data) {
          var temp = data['temperature'],
              pressure = data['pressure'];

          console.log("temperature " + temp  + " pressure " + pressure);
        });
      }

Now that our robot knows what work to do, and the work it will be doing that
hardware with, we can start it:

    }).start();
